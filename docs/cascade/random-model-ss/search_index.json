This investigation can be considered as an extension of the random model ROC and PR curves (for CASCADE 2.0, link operator mutations) I created for the AGS paper I (see here). In that analysis, I generated a \\(3000\\) random model sample, and took only the models that had 1 stable state to compute their ROC performance. So maybe I neede to generate more models or bootstrap (re-sample) these models to get a better picture of what is going on and that’s what I am trying to do here :) Input The random link-operator mutated models were generated from the CASCADE 2.0 topology, using the abmlog software, version 1.6.0. Their prediction performance was assessed by the Drabme software module, via the druglogics-synergy Java module, version 1.2.0. I run the following command to get the random models from the abmlog repo root (took ~165 min to generate all \\(50000\\) models): java -cp target/abmlog-1.6.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar eu.druglogics.abmlog.RandomBooleanModelGenerator --file=test/cascade_2_0.sif --num=50000 I splitted the models to 3 groups: those that have no 1 stable state, 2 stable states or none at all. There was only 1 model in \\(50000\\) (cascade_2_0_418669279901714.gitsbe) that had 3 stable states and so we will not take into account models with more than 2 stable states (very rare and almost impossible to be chosen via Gitsbe since it indirectly penalizes models with more than 1 attractors). The distribution of models in each category were (use the count_ss.sh script): #Stable states #Models Percentage 0 29027 58% 1 20672 41% 2 300 1% 3 1 less than 0.01% From the ags_cascade_2.0 directory of the druglogics-synergy module I ran the run.sh script. This script bootstraps \\(50\\) models (\\(20\\) times in total) from each category and runs the Drabme with those. So bootstraping \\(50\\) models \\(\\times \\text{ }20\\) times with 0 stable states, \\(50\\) models \\(\\times \\text{ }20\\) times with 1 stable state, etc. We also try all pair-wise combinations: {(\\(25\\) models with 0 stable states) + (\\(25\\) models with 1 stable state)} \\(\\times\\text{ }20\\) times, etc. Lastly, we merge all of the different stable state models together in a pool of \\(25\\times3=75\\) models (again bootstraping \\(20\\) such samples). The generated random models and the results of the Drabme simulations are stored in Libraries library(emba) library(stringr) library(xfun) library(PRROC) library(dplyr) library(ggpubr) Analysis Note that data_dir in the next code-block is the directory where you uncompress the Zenodo dataset file (tar -xzvf boot_random_ss.tar.gz). The ss_class denotes the model group. E.g. ss0 is the group with models with zero stable state, ss12 is the group with half the models having 1 stable state and half of the others having 2 stable states, etc. observed_synergies_file = &quot;data/observed_synergies_cascade_2.0&quot; observed_synergies = emba::get_observed_synergies(observed_synergies_file) data_dir = &quot;/home/john/tmp/ags_paper_res/link-only/hsa/bootstrap_random_ss&quot; res_dirs = list.files(data_dir, full.names = TRUE) data_list = list() index = 1 for (dir in res_dirs) { if (stringr::str_detect(string = dir, pattern = &quot;cascade_2.0_random_hsa_ss&quot;)) { # How many stable states the models had? ss_class = str_match(string = dir, pattern = &quot;_(ss\\\\d+)_&quot;)[1,2] # Get the ensemble-wise synergies ew_syn_file = list.files(path = dir, pattern = &quot;_ensemblewise_synergies.tab&quot;, full.names = TRUE) ew_synergies = emba::get_synergy_scores(ew_syn_file) observed = sapply(ew_synergies$perturbation %in% observed_synergies, as.integer) # ROC AUC (Ensemble-wise) ew_roc = roc.curve(scores.class0 = ew_synergies %&gt;% pull(score) %&gt;% (function(x) {-x}), weights.class0 = observed) ew_roc_auc = ew_roc$auc # PR AUC (Ensemble-wise) ew_pr = pr.curve(scores.class0 = ew_synergies %&gt;% pull(score) %&gt;% (function(x) {-x}), weights.class0 = observed) ew_pr_auc = ew_pr$auc.davis.goadrich # Get the model-wise synergies mw_syn_file = list.files(path = dir, pattern = &quot;_modelwise_synergies.tab&quot;, full.names = TRUE) mw_synergies = emba::get_synergy_scores(mw_syn_file, file_type = &quot;modelwise&quot;) mw_synergies = mw_synergies %&gt;% mutate(synergy_prob = case_when( synergies == 0 &amp; `non-synergies` == 0 ~ 0, TRUE ~ synergies/(synergies + `non-synergies`))) # ROC AUC (Model-wise) mw_roc = roc.curve(scores.class0 = mw_synergies %&gt;% pull(synergy_prob), weights.class0 = observed) mw_roc_auc = mw_roc$auc # PR AUC (Model-wise) mw_pr = pr.curve(scores.class0 = mw_synergies %&gt;% pull(synergy_prob), weights.class0 = observed) mw_pr_auc = mw_pr$auc.davis.goadrich # Merge results data_list[[index]] = dplyr::bind_cols(ss_class = ss_class, roc_auc = ew_roc_auc, pr_auc = ew_pr_auc, method = &quot;ensemble-wise&quot;) index = index + 1 data_list[[index]] = dplyr::bind_cols(ss_class = ss_class, roc_auc = mw_roc_auc, pr_auc = mw_pr_auc, method = &quot;model-wise&quot;) index = index + 1 } } res = dplyr::bind_rows(data_list) saveRDS(res, file = &quot;data/res.rds&quot;) We will just load the result for efficiency: res = readRDS(file = &quot;data/res.rds&quot;) Ensemble-wise Synergies my_comparisons = list(c(&quot;ss0&quot;, &quot;ss1&quot;), c(&quot;ss0&quot;, &quot;ss2&quot;), c(&quot;ss1&quot;, &quot;ss2&quot;), c(&quot;ss0&quot;, &quot;ss01&quot;), c(&quot;ss1&quot;, &quot;ss01&quot;), c(&quot;ss2&quot;, &quot;ss02&quot;), c(&quot;ss01&quot;, &quot;ss012&quot;), c(&quot;ss12&quot;, &quot;ss012&quot;)) ggboxplot(data = res %&gt;% filter(method == &quot;ensemble-wise&quot;), x = &quot;ss_class&quot;, y = &quot;roc_auc&quot;, fill = &quot;ss_class&quot;, xlab = &quot;Random Model Group (#Stable States)&quot;, ylab = &quot;ROC AUC&quot;, order = c(&quot;ss0&quot;, &quot;ss1&quot;, &quot;ss2&quot;, &quot;ss01&quot;, &quot;ss02&quot;, &quot;ss12&quot;, &quot;ss012&quot;)) + stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons, method = &quot;wilcox.test&quot;, label = &quot;p.signif&quot;) ggboxplot(data = res %&gt;% filter(method == &quot;ensemble-wise&quot;), x = &quot;ss_class&quot;, y = &quot;pr_auc&quot;, fill = &quot;ss_class&quot;, xlab = &quot;Random Model Group (#Stable States)&quot;, ylab = &quot;PR AUC&quot;, order = c(&quot;ss0&quot;, &quot;ss1&quot;, &quot;ss2&quot;, &quot;ss01&quot;, &quot;ss02&quot;, &quot;ss12&quot;, &quot;ss012&quot;)) + stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons, method = &quot;wilcox.test&quot;, label = &quot;p.signif&quot;) ROC AUC results are somewhat analogous to the PR AUC results Getting a complete random sample of models with 1 stable state is enough to give you a valid ROC AUC (average AUC: 0.659212) - the ss1 group is one of the highest-performing groups Getting a decent random sample (keeping true to the models proportions as seeing in the table above) means being close to what the class ss01 represents. The class ss01 is 50-50 and a genuine decent random sample would be ~60-40 (60% models with 0 stable states and 40% models with 1 stable state), but we see that the 0 stable state models do not add AUC points (if I am allowed such terminology :) to any group that they are combined with! Continuing, the ss01 group is indistiguisable performance-wise from the ss1 group - meaning that using just the \\(1\\) stable state models as a random sample for this topology (CASCADE 2.0) is a good enough choice! Model-wise Synergies ggboxplot(data = res %&gt;% filter(method == &quot;model-wise&quot;), x = &quot;ss_class&quot;, y = &quot;roc_auc&quot;, fill = &quot;ss_class&quot;, xlab = &quot;Random Model Group (#Stable States)&quot;, ylab = &quot;ROC AUC&quot;, order = c(&quot;ss0&quot;, &quot;ss1&quot;, &quot;ss2&quot;, &quot;ss01&quot;, &quot;ss02&quot;, &quot;ss12&quot;, &quot;ss012&quot;)) + stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons, method = &quot;wilcox.test&quot;, label = &quot;p.signif&quot;) ggboxplot(data = res %&gt;% filter(method == &quot;model-wise&quot;), x = &quot;ss_class&quot;, y = &quot;pr_auc&quot;, fill = &quot;ss_class&quot;, xlab = &quot;Random Model Group (#Stable States)&quot;, ylab = &quot;PR AUC&quot;, order = c(&quot;ss0&quot;, &quot;ss1&quot;, &quot;ss2&quot;, &quot;ss01&quot;, &quot;ss02&quot;, &quot;ss12&quot;, &quot;ss012&quot;)) + stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons, method = &quot;wilcox.test&quot;, label = &quot;p.signif&quot;) Same results as above. Note that the model-wise methodology (used to calculate the synergy scores) seems to be more granular: it’s easier to distinguish the different categories performance using this methodology.
